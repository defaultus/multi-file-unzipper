# multi-file-unzipper
a 'customizable' multi file unzipper written in python using the tkinter library utilizing multithreading to work on multiple files concurrently and some customizable theming using ttkbootstrap.

# how to use
1. install 7zip cli tool, this is used to do the actual unzipping.
   For windows you can install 7zip cli via its official [downloads page](https://www.7-zip.org/)
   For linux you can insstall 8zip cli via a simple command: ``` sudo apt install p7zip-full ```
3. have python installed
4. ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` to install its requirements (which is only 2 items).
5. ``` pytohn3 main.py ``` to run and use the app.


# clarification and a lack of experience
I put customizable in quotes mainly because while I think I am good at making my code clear to understand others might not think so.
as well as, when it came to writing the multithreaded portion of the code I immediately gave up on comments. The reason being I was done watching a ton on tutorials on python multithreading and multithreading vs async YouTube videos and I definitely don't know enough, especially not enough to write any meaningful comments on it.
