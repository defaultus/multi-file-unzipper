# multi-file-unzipper
a 'customizable' multi file unzipper written in python using the tkinter library utilizing multithreading to work on multiple files concurrently and some cutsomizable theming using ttkbootstrap.
I put customizable in quotes mainly because while I think I am good at making my code clear to understand others might not think so.
as well as, when it came to writing the multithreaded portion of the code I immedietly gave up on comments. The reason being I was done watching a ton on tutorials on python multithreading and multithreading vs async youtube videos and I definetly don't know enough, especially not enough to write any meaningfull comments on it.

# how to use
1. have python installed
2. ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` to install its requirements (which is only 2 items).
3. ``` pytohn3 main.py ``` to run and use the app.
